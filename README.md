# Basic_Django_blog
This is a basic Django blog, with an integrated translator and bootstrap styles. 

I have also used a sqlite DB to store blog data added by admin, including time author ect.

I have tried to use inheritence for the templates, inorder to avoid repeating myself and my code.

I have utilised bootstrap styles to stylize the post cards and nav-bar ect. I have also included my own css files to add some more styles
